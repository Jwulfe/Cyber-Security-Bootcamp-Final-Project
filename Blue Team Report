##Network Topology
The following machines were identified on the network:
Name of VM 1: Kali
Operating System:Kali
Purpose: Red team usage; use to attack Target 1 and 2
IP Address: 192.168.1.90
Name of VM 2: Target 1
Operating System: Linux 3.2-4.9
Purpose: Hosts website RavenSecurity
IP Address: 192.168.1.110
Name of VM 3: Target 2
Operating System: Linux 3.2-4.9
Purpose: Second Box to attack
IP Address: 192.168.1.115
Name of VM 4: ELK
Operating System: No scans on NMAP
Purpose: Generates logs
IP Address: 192.168.1.100
Name of VM 5: Capstone
Operating System: Linux 3.2-4.9
Purpose: Practice alerts
IP Address: 192.168.1.105
Description of Targets
The target of this attack was: Target 1 (192.168.1.110).
Target 1 is an Apache web server and has SSH enabled, so ports 80 and 22 are possible ports of entry for attackers. As such, the following alerts have been implemented:
Monitoring the Targets
Traffic to these services should be carefully monitored. To this end, we have implemented the alerts below:
#### Name of Alert 1:
Packetbeat: HTTP Response Code
Alert 1 is implemented as follows:
Metric: HTTP response code
Threshold: Above 400
Vulnerability Mitigated: Determines an alert based on http response code.
Reliability: Medium, depending on how active the site is used. There were a few pings that triggered this alert.
## Name of Alert 2
Packetbeat: HTTP Request Bytes
Alert 2 is implemented as follows:
Metric: Packetbeat: HTTP request bytes threshold
Threshold: 3500
Vulnerability Mitigated: Data accessing thresholds.
Reliability: Low: The majority of alerts, if I am correctly reading my Kibana, is from request bytes.
## Name of Alert 3
Metricbeat CPU Utilization
Alert 3 is implemented as follows:
Metric: Metricbeat: CPU process power
Threshold: Over 0.5%
Vulnerability Mitigated: Mitigates excessive task power which might seem abnormal to regular functions.
Reliability: High: most of the pings were of less than .3% of cpu utilization.
